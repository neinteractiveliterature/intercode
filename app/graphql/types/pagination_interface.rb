  description <<~MARKDOWN
    PaginationInterface provides a way to use offset-based pagination on a list of objects.  This
    is useful for UIs such as Intercode's table views, which provide a way to jump between numbered
    pages.

    Page numbers in PaginationInterface are 1-based (so, the first page is page 1, then page 2,
    etc.)  The number of items per page can be controlled via the per_page argument on paginated
    fields.  It defaults to 20, and can go up to 200.

    Offset-based pagination is different from
    [Relay's cursor-based pagination](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) that is more
    commonly used in GraphQL APIs.  We chose to go with an offset-based approach due to our UI
    needs, but if a cursor-based approach is desirable in the future, we may also implement Relay
    connections alongside our existing pagination fields.
