# Classes that include ActiveModel::Model can say `extend ActsAsCoder` to be usable as ActiveRecord serialization
# coders.  This will enable ActiveRecord models to embed more complex business logic configuration as JSON fields.
# This works with databases that support JSON datatypes natively (e.g. PostgreSQL) or ones that don't (e.g. SQLite3).
