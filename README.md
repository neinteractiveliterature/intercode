Intercode is a web application that:

- serves as the public-facing web site for a convention
- automates signup and payment
- automates business processes for the convention staff

[The original Intercode](https://github.com/neinteractiveliterature/intercode-classic) was written in PHP by Barry Tannenbaum for Intercon New England, and has since been used by several other conventions around the world.

Intercode 2 is a ground-up rewrite of Intercode, making it more robust, more flexible, and more modern.

# Overall Architecture

- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails application exposing a GraphQL API and an OpenID Connect-enabled OAuth2 server
- **Frontend**: React and Apollo-based single-page JavaScript app
- **Database engine**: PostgreSQL
- **Background queue system**: Amazon SQS + Shoryuken (this might change in the future)
- **Production infrastructure**: For [New England Interactive Literature](http://interactiveliterature.org)'s installation of Intercode, we're hosting it on [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and running it as Docker containers (as opposed to using buildpacks). However, since we removed libgraphql-parser from the build, Heroku buildpacks may also work (but we haven't tested it since removing the library).

# Getting Started with Developing Intercode

- Intercode 2 in development mode uses `intercode.test` as its cookie domain. If you use `localhost` to visit the site, that will mysteriously fail. I'm going to try to make the site detect the wrong domain and redirect you, but for now, please just use the `intercode.test` domain name.
- We used to support a Docker Compose-based development workflow, but this has been deprecated. Please run Rails locally using the instructions below.

## Developer Quickstart with local Rails

This is the classic Rails development setup, and should work for Mac and Linux users.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/neinteractiveliterature/intercode.git`
2. Make sure you have a working C/C++ development toolchain installed. On macOS, that's Xcode and its Command Line Tools.
3. Install [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#readme)
4. Install [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build#readme)
5. Edit your hosts file (typically found in `/etc/hosts` on Mac and Linux systems) and add the following line: `127.0.0.1 intercode.test`
6. `cd` to the Intercode source folder, all the remaining steps should be performed in that folder.
7. Install all the dependencies of Intercode:

   1. Install the Ruby version Intercode requires: `rbenv install`
   2. Install Bundler: `gem install bundler`
   3. Install PostgreSQL. With Homebrew: `brew install postgres`
   4. Make sure you have Node.js installed. With Homebrew: `brew install node`
   5. Make sure you have Yarn installed. With Homebrew: `brew install yarn`
   6. `bundle install`

8. Generate self-signed certificates to support HTTPS

   1. `gem install toys`
   2. `toys setup_tls`

9. Set up your local database: `bin/rails db:create db:migrate`
10. Install JavaScript packages: `yarn install`
11. Start up the Intercode server: `bin/rails server`
12. Start up the Webpack server: `yarn run start`
13. You should now be able to go to <http://intercode.test:5000> and see the app running!

## Testing production builds

If you want to test how the app runs in production, but using your local development installation, you can do so as follows:

1. Build Docker images for Intercode: `docker build --target production -t local-intercode-production .`
2. Install the `dev-proxy` npm package: `npm install -g dev-proxy`
3. Run `dev-proxy` to start proxying HTTPS locally: `dev-proxy -p 5001:5000`
4. Run something like the following command, changing the asset host as necessary for your setup: `docker run -it -p 5001:3000 -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@docker.for.mac.localhost/intercode_development -e RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true -e ASSETS_HOST=//intercont.intercode.test:5000 -e RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true local-intercode-production bin/rails`
5. Visit <https://some-convention-domain.intercode.test:5000>, probably using Firefox (it seems to deal better than Chrome with self-signed certificates these days).
