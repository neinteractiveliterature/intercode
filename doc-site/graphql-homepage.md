Intercode uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) for its API. This API is used both by Intercode
itself and third-party applications.

The documentation in this section has been automatically generated from the Intercode GraphQL schema.

Use the docs in the sidebar to find out how to use the schema:

- **Allowed operations**: queries and mutations.
- **Schema-defined types**: scalars, objects, enums, interfaces, unions, and input objects.
