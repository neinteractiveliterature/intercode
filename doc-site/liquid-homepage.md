Intercode uses the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template language for user-generated content. Convention
admins can take advantage of Liquid markup to create dynamic pages that tailor their content to the user viewing them.

Liquid comes with a variety of standard filters, tags, and blocks that are available to all applications that use it.
Intercode makes these available in templates by default. These are documented at
[the official Liquid site](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

Intercode also provides a variety of additional extensions to make information about conventions, events, users, etc.
available to CMS templates. These are documented here.

Use the docs in the sidebar to find out how to use Intercode's Liquid extensions:

- **Available variables**: the variables you can use by default in Intercode Liquid templates.
- **Blocks**: custom blocks that can be wrapped around content.
- **Drops**: representations of Intercode objects that can be used in Liquid templates.
- **Filters**: extra filtering functions that can be applied to variables and expressions.
- **Tags**: custom Liquid tags that can be used with `{% ... %}` syntax.
