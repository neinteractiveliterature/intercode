Intercode is now able to send SMS (text message) notifications! For conventions that keep online event signups open during the con itself, Intercode will deliver notifications of signups, withdrawals, and waitlist pulls starting 24 hours before the start of the convention. The text of notifications is customizable via the "Notification templates" feature in the Admin section.

Users can opt out of SMS notifications via a new setting in their user profile for a convention. Texts will come from 415-NEIL-010 (415-634-5010).
