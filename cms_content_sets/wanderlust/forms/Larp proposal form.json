Smaller larps (fewer than 10 players) and boffer-style larps (or other larps) which require large space needs may be accepted on a conditional basis during these time periods until after initial scheduling takes place. The more flexibility you can provide in your scheduling options, the greater the ability to have the game accepted and scheduled. Sunday, morning, midnight, and Thursday slots are encouraged. "
