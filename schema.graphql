PaginationInterface provides a way to use offset-based pagination on a list of objects. This
is useful for UIs such as Intercode's table views, which provide a way to jump between numbered
pages.

Page numbers in PaginationInterface are 1-based (so, the first page is page 1, then page 2,
etc.) The number of items per page can be controlled via the per_page argument on paginated
fields. It defaults to 20, and can go up to 200.

Offset-based pagination is different from
[Relay's cursor-based pagination](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) that is more
commonly used in GraphQL APIs. We chose to go with an offset-based approach due to our UI
needs, but if a cursor-based approach is desirable in the future, we may also implement Relay
connections alongside our existing pagination fields.
