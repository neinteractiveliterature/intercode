# To get a reCAPTCHA v2 keypair, go to: http://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin

# also want to uncheck "Verify the origin of reCAPTCHA solutions".

# These are required if you want to accept payments.  To get a keypair, sign up

# These are required if you want to auto-onboard Stripe Connect accounts for
# convention organizers so they can accept payments.  This is not an easy
# workflow to test locally and I don't really recommend it, but if you want
# to, you'll need to get Stripe to somehow be able to connect to your
# development machine.  You can then set up webhooks in test mode, and enter
# the secrets here.
